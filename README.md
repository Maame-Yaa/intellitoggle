## üìù Notes

- The project is hosted on Vercel. You can easily deploy it using their platform.
- The project taught me the similarities between MERN and the Nuxt + Vue + Tailwind stack, and how the latter stack makes routing and styling much easier
- Tradeoff included using relative sizing to complete on time.
- What can be done with more time is make the site less compact on mobile, add more pages and more content for usable links
